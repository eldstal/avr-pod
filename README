If you have an AVR device with the full 8 ADC channels pinned out,
you can remove the analog mux from the circuit and reconfigure podcontrols.c
to use the build-in ADMUX, set all PORTC pins as analog inputs, etc.

See wiring.txt for a breakdown of the circuitry

The following make rules are used:

hex     -  Build the program
fuse    -  Set the AVR's fuses for a 16MHz external crystal
flash   -  Write the program to AVR flash
program - hex, fuse, flash
