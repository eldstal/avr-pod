The panel of doom has the following input devices:

Three on/off switches
Six rotary potentiometers
One slide potentiometer

The following output devices:
Nine LEDs (Three red, Three green, Three red in the switches).

The LEDs are connected in three banks of three LEDs each, with common anodes
inside the bank and controlled cathodes across (i.e. one red, one green, one
switch all share the same cathode.)

The switches furthermore share their anode with the switch LEDs and are therefore
only available when that LED bank is switched on.

The potentiometers (10Kohm linear) each deliver a voltage between 0 and 5 volts
as they are connected as voltage dividers across the main +5v feed.

The voltage outputs of the potentiometer are connected to a CD4051 analog multiplexer
(due to the DIP AVR328 only having 6 analog inputs).

This makes a total of 20 connections between the panel and the motherboard:
